# Quantitative-Calculation-Program-of-Wet-Steam-Loss
Quantitative Calculation Program of Wet Steam Loss
This program is based on the results of three-dimensional non-equilibrium condensation flow of multistage turbine, and necessary treatment is carried out for the results. The program language FORTRAN 77 is used to run on Compaq Visual Fortran version 6.6 platform, and the quantitative calculation of wet steam loss is carried out.
